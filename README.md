# Systems Best Practices
Best Practices for developing and maintaining complex &amp; diverse systems.

## About
This is a documentation repository for sharing best practices for managing, monitoring, and collaborating across complex systems. Orginally inspired by the complexity of autonomous robots and airplanes, it's clear that organizations struggle with sharing knowledge, understanding system status, and breaking down information silos.

This resource is targeting for Software Engineers, Hardware Engineers, Operations, Test Engineers, QA, Product Managers, Systems Engineering and much more.

#### "_You don't know what you don't know_". 
Developing scalable systems practices that are both lightweight and require little maintainance equips people with the necessary threshold knowledge make meaningful contributions.

### Why Now?
As defined by MIT's _Introduction to Systems Engineering_: "systems engineering is an interdisciplinary engineering management process that evolves and verifies an integrated, life-cycle balanced set of system solutions that satisfy customer needs."

Systems Engineering (or something similar) is critical as our products become more complex. Businesses need to understand the state of their system(s) to serve their customers and deliver value. In the past, the bulk of systems engineering work is done at the beginning of product developement. Today, bleeding edge tech is integrated into products as that tech is developed, making it difficult to plan the system that far in advance. This makes the "old ways" of systems engineering infeasible. 

### Product Development Overview

#### Traditional Product Development Process

The V model is sequential.

The Agile model is cyclical.
